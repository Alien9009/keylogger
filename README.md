KeyLogger: Secure Keylogging & Data Traceability KeyLogger is a Python project that captures keyboard input, organizes logs with datetime-based filenames, and securely stores them locally and on Google Cloud Storage. It offers email alerts using Gmail API. Enhance data traceability and privacy with KeyLogger# keylogger 
This project is a Python-based keylogger featuring user authentication, a graphical user interface (GUI), and email log delivery. Designed for educational purposes, it demonstrates the integration of keyboard event handling, secure password management, and email automation. The program requires users to authenticate with a username and password, securely hashed using SHA-256, ensuring only authorized access. A Tkinter-based GUI allows users to control the keylogger with ease, featuring buttons to start and stop logging.

The keylogger captures keystrokes, including special keys like Enter, Tab, and Space, and saves them to a local file. For added functionality, the collected keystrokes can be emailed to a predefined recipient using Gmail's SMTP server. Thread-safe operations are ensured when handling shared resources, improving reliability during execution.

To use, set up email credentials and initialize user login details during the first run. Once authenticated, the user can control the keylogger through the GUI. The application also automatically sends the log file via email upon stopping the keylogger. This project highlights essential programming skills, including file handling, multithreading, and secure communication. It is intended strictly for ethical and educational purposes, ensuring compliance with all legal requirements and obtaining proper permissions before use.
